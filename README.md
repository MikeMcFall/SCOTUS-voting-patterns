# SCOTUS-voting-patterns
This project uses the data on Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) cases available at http://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php
to determine how often each of the justices have voted with each of the others in cases from 1946 - 2017. It then uses 
hierarchical clustering to group the current justices as well as the justices on the court in 1946.

I used Tableau to visually analyze the data I extracted and found that while the Court today may be more polarized than in 1946,
in both eras there were two clear groups of Justices that often voted together.
A presentation of the results can be found on my Tableau Public page at
