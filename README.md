# SCOTUS-voting-patterns
This project uses the data on Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) cases available at http://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php
to determine how often each of the justices have voted with each of the others in cases from 1946 - 2017. It then uses 
hierarchical clustering to group the current justices as well as the justices on the court in 1946.

An overview of the results can be found on my Tableau Public page at
